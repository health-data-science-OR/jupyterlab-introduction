    "In this study we will use a basic form of the GRASP metaheuristic algorithm to solve the symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). In the TSP a salesman must visit a set of cities once and only once in the shortest possible distance (or time).  The Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure (**GRASP**) was introduced by Rio and Resende in 1989. It is an extremely simple multi-start **metaheuristic**. The basic form of GRASP is based on two phases:\n",

    "1. an initial semi-greedy construction/repair phase; \n",
    "2. a period of local search to improve on the initial solution.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Semi-greedy construction\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental part of GRASP is semi-greedy construction.  In a purely **greedy construction** method for the TSP we select a starting point in the tour and then choose the next closest city (the nearest neighbour algorithm). We continue to do this until all cities are visited. In contrast in **Semi-Greedy construction** we modify the approach to incorporate the probability. Instead of always visiting the closest city there is now a probability that we visit one of the n closest cities.  Therefore semi-greedy algorithms are a half way house between random and greedy search.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Restricted Candidate Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in semi-greedy construction is to create the restricted candidate list: the list of top valued components that the algorithm will choose from in its next step. In the TSP a straightforward implementation is choosing the closest r cities where r is a hyper-parameter that can be fixed, a random variable or learned over time.\n",
