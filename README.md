# HPDM097: Making a difference with health data.  

## An introduction to using JupyterLab for data science

Jupyter-lab is the defacto tool for modern reproducible data science in Python. In this short class you will learn how to setup JupyterLab, execute code; control the Jupyter Kernel; and write Markdown.

> This is a general introduction to Jupyter and is useful for any data science course using Linux, Mac or Windows.

**Requirements**

* It is recommended that at - a minimum - down and install a Anaconda 3 distribution https://www.anaconda.com/
* **The default base conda environment is sufficient to run the notebooks in this class.**
* For those wishing to use the same version of Jupyter and Python, the class is also provided with a conda virtual environment: `hds_learn_jupyter`.  To install the dependences run the following in a terminal:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate hds_learn_jupyter
```
